"""The capture BROWSER: one deterministic way to open a vendor page and save its download.

Owner, 2026-07-27: *"literally make the best environment for us ... something that works on both
windows and linux so its not hard for u to test it"*.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the problem it removes)
Guided capture used to live entirely inside the pywebview WebView2 window, and that had three
costs, all of them measured rather than supposed:

1. **It is Windows-only, so the whole flow was untestable from Linux.** The frontend's only route
   in is `window.pywebview.api.open_cad_download` (`lib/capture.tsx`), which does not exist off
   Windows, so on Linux the flow silently degrades to "pick the files yourself". That is exactly
   why an agent could verify the URL layer and the selector layer but never the layer the owner
   actually sees.
2. **pywebview exposes NO public download-intercept API** (verified and recorded at
   `host/window.py:201`), so tier 1 monkeypatched pywebview's private WinForms/WebView2 internals
   and tier 2 polled `~/Downloads`. That coupling is logged as risk R3 in the guided-capture spec.
3. **CDP cannot rescue it**: `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` returns invalid-argument (0x80070057)
   in WebView2, so the one API that would have made downloads observable there does not work.

Playwright, which this repo ALREADY bundles for the scrape engine (`pyproject.toml`), has a
public, documented download API (`expect_download` / `save_as`) and gives real waiting primitives
instead of sleeps. So the capture browser is Playwright, and the vendor logic moves OUT of injected
JS in `host/` into ordinary Python that a test can drive anywhere.

WHAT STAYS AS IT WAS
The APP SHELL is still pywebview/WebView2 on Windows: that decision (spec 2026-07-12 section 3) is
about hosting our own frontend, where Python-as-host and native drag/drop paths genuinely win, and
nothing here disturbs it. This module is only about the SECOND window - the vendor page.

A NOTE ON THE PERSISTENT PROFILE, which is not a free choice
Vendor logins must survive between parts, which means a persistent user-data dir. Playwright and
Chromium permit only one owner of a user-data dir at a time. Production therefore gives every
provider its own profile and holds an explicit inter-process profile lock for the whole browser
session. Two workers can drive different providers, but two workers can never corrupt the same
provider's cookies or browser state.
