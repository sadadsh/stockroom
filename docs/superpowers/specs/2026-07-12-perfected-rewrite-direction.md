# Perfected rewrite direction (reconciled)

> **HOME = this repo (owner redirect, 2026-07-12).** The rewrite lives in and ships from THIS

> INTO this stockroom repo (see `docs/` and `legacy/`). This is the **authoritative reconciled

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Product:** Stockroom (owner-confirmed). The rewrite ships under this name from this repo.
**Status:** Design approved (brainstorm); building the new-direction deltas into the shipped M1/M2 engine.
**Supersedes:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-webapp-rewrite-foundation-design.md` (the Electron
web-app Foundation spec). This document reconciles that spec with the Stockroom clean-room effort
(`~/git/stockroom`, summarized in `Stockroom-Knowledge-Transfer.md`) into one authoritative direction.
**Related detailed specs (kept):** the Stockroom design spec and per-milestone plans remain the
detailed engine specs; this document is the top-level direction they slot into.

No em dashes anywhere (standing owner rule for rewrite output).

## 1. Why this document

On 2026-07-12 two rewrite efforts ran in parallel: an Electron web-app Foundation spec in this repo
(reuse the old PyQt Python unchanged, Components plus Projects, coexist with PyQt), and Stockroom, a
clean-room rewrite in its own repo (pywebview/WebView2, byte-preserving KiCad layer, git-synced
library-as-repo, Components-only, already shipping M1 with M2 landing). They conflicted on nearly
every load-bearing axis. The owner directed a best-of-both synthesis, full Components plus Projects
scope with no capability regression, consolidated into one repo. This document is that synthesis.

## 2. The governing invariant (what keeps this from becoming a Frankenstein)

Every decision below hangs off one statable rule:

> **Clean-room owns every WRITE. Reused logic is READ and COMPUTE only.**
> The clean-room engine (byte-preserving KiCad file layer, library data model, git, mutation engine)
> is the only thing that writes KiCad files, part records, or commits. The mature old logic is reused
> only for analysis and field production (enrichment, BOM, project health, readiness). Any reused
> function that today writes a KiCad file is re-routed through the clean-room writer.

This is a boundary, not a tangle. Clean-room owns writing (where byte-preservation and git-cleanliness
must hold); reuse owns reading and computing (where the old logic is battle-tested and rebuilding is
pure waste). The one integration discipline is that a reused Projects mutation (design rules, net
classes, board setup) writes through the clean-room span layer, never the old reformatting writer.

### 2.1 Zero Qt in the backend (hard constraint)

The rewrite backend imports **zero PyQt**. A FastAPI service must never depend on a GUI toolkit. This
reshapes "reuse" into **reuse-by-extraction**: the mature logic is lifted out of the old Qt-coupled
modules into new Qt-free modules, preserving the algorithms and behavior (verified against the old
tests) while dropping every Qt import. A CI gate greps the backend package for `PyQt5`, `QtCore`,
`QtWidgets`, and `QtGui` and fails the build on any hit, so the constraint cannot rot (this matches the
app's existing no-fault-gate culture).

The coupling reality this must clear (measured 2026-07-12): only `LibraryManager.py` imports PyQt
directly (a top-level import plus a couple of lazy `QMessageBox`/`QFileDialog` prompts that do not
belong in a backend anyway). It is the **Qt hub**: it also imports `fp_render` (Qt-heavy), and most
`nd_*` modules import `LibraryManager` (mostly lazily), so importing them as-is would drag Qt in
transitively. Extraction therefore: (a) lifts LibraryManager's pure logic (the BOM subsystem, the
Mouser/enrichment client, library parsing, place-and-link, merge) into Qt-free modules; (b) satisfies
the `parse_sexpr` dependency from the clean-room s-expression layer, not `fp_render`; (c) re-points
every `nd_*` import at the extracted Qt-free modules; (d) never imports `fp_render` (previews are
kicad-cli plus three.js). The `nd_*` modules reference no Qt symbols themselves, and `kicad_tools.py`
is already Qt-free, so the extraction is bounded and well-defined rather than open-ended.

### 2.2 Responsive, snappy, fail-proof (non-functional contract, owner directive)

Every surface must feel instant and never lose or half-write data. This is a first-class
requirement, enforced per milestone, not a hope.

Responsive and snappy:
- The window never blocks. Any operation over ~100ms runs off the UI/request path as a background
  job with SSE progress (ingest, enrich, scrape, BOM build, prepare); quick reads and mutations are
  synchronous REST.
- Reads are served from the derived SQLite index (order of the index, not order of the files on
  disk), so search, facets, and duplicate detection stay instant at thousands of parts. The index is
  built on load and after each pull, and kept warm.
- Previews are cached on disk keyed by content hash; the frontend uses TanStack Query caching plus
  optimistic updates. No synchronous network call ever sits on the UI path.

Fail-proof:
- Every library mutation is one git-backed atomic transaction: it commits as a single scoped commit
  or restores every touched path and leaves zero trace. A failure never leaves a half-written library.
- The complete-to-add gate fails BEFORE any write, so a rejected add leaves zero trace.
- Honest degradation: no swallowed errors; partial results are labeled partial; every failure states
  what happened and what to do. Offline and divergence are first-class states, surfaced with exact
  state and safe options, never clobbered.
- The derived index is a rebuildable cache, never the source of truth, so a corrupt or missing index
  rebuilds from the JSON files and cannot lose data.
- The byte-preserving layer fails loud on overlapping or corrupt edits (never splices garbage); the
  independent semantic-diff gate verifies every edit. Inputs are validated at the boundary (vendor
  zips fingerprinted by content, datasheets validated by magic bytes, version stamps never invented).
- Concurrency-safe: symbol-lib writes take a file lock once behind concurrent API requests (M5).
- Enforced by tests: zero-trace-on-failure and fail-injection tests assert no partial state ever
  survives, at every layer that writes.

## 3. Per-axis synthesis decisions

| Axis | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| KiCad file surgery | **Clean-room** (Stockroom span-preserving s-expression layer) | Byte-preservation is the whole game for a git-synced library; every off-the-shelf lib was disqualifying and the old writer reformats on write. Verified, already shipped as M1. |
| Library model, profiles, git sync, mutation engine | **Clean-room** (Stockroom) | Git-native source of truth; already built and tested in M2. |
| Ingestion (zip fingerprint, legacy upgrade, 3D relink) | **Clean-room** (Stockroom M3) | Content-fingerprint identity is correct; the old app has no equivalent. |
| **Shell** | **WebView2 via pywebview, NOT Electron** | Target is Windows-only and all logic is Python, so Electron's cross-platform and Node-main-process buy nothing while costing a second runtime plus a bundled Chromium. WebView2: Python is the host process, native drag/drop delivers full zip paths to Python, and the same engine is the scraping fallback for bot-protected sites. This is the one axis where the Electron spec is overruled. |
| Frontend | **Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + TanStack Query + cmdk + three.js** (from the Electron spec) | Both specs agree on React/Tailwind; this ports the existing web mockups faithfully and closes the "looks nothing like the mockup" gap the PyQt port never did. |
| Backend API | **FastAPI thin veneer** (both specs agree) | The surface is API plumbing, not logic. |
| **Enrichment** | **Reuse by extraction (Qt-free)** the old Mouser client, rate-limit/SRC-04 handling, and parser, and fold in the generic URL parser, WebView2 rendered-DOM fallback, and datasheet fetcher | Best of both: proven Mouser code plus the scraper that makes completeness achievable without the API cap (see section 6). |
| **BOM and procurement** | **Reuse by extraction (Qt-free)** the LibraryManager BOM subsystem (~20 functions: `bom_cost_summary`, `bom_from_project`, `consolidated_bom`, `bom_diff`, `bom_procurement_summary`, `bom_xlsx`, and so on) | Mature pure logic; rebuilding is waste. Lifted into Qt-free modules (section 2.1). |
| **Projects (health, editor, net classes, design rules, board setup, fab/design presets)** | **Reuse by extraction (Qt-free)** the `nd_*` modules (re-pointed off the Qt hub), routing their KiCad writes through the clean-room layer | The entire Projects capability already exists; its writes re-route through Layer 0 and its `LibraryManager` imports re-point to the extracted Qt-free modules (section 2.1). |
| Previews | **Replace** `fp_render` (33 lines of Qt) with kicad-cli SVG plus three.js/GLB | Keeps the backend Qt-free and always matches the installed KiCad. |
| Update model | **git-pull ff-only self-update, frozen-once launcher, library-as-repo** | Ships code, UI, and library data in one pull; fits the git-native design. (Confirm in section 12.) |

## 4. Architecture: the layered stack

```
Layer 6  Frontend SPA        React + TS + Tailwind + TanStack Query + cmdk + three.js
Layer 5  Host + API          pywebview WebView2 window  +  FastAPI thin veneer  +  frozen-once launcher
Layer 4  Projects (reuse)    nd_* modules: health, editor, net classes, design rules, board setup, BOM
Layer 3  Enrichment (reuse+) old Mouser client  +  generic scraper  +  WebView2 DOM fallback  +  datasheet fetcher
Layer 2  Ingestion (clean)   content-fingerprint zip adapters, legacy upgrade, 3D relink, staging
Layer 1  Library core (clean) data model + profiles + git sync + atomic mutation engine + derived SQLite index
Layer 0  KiCad file surgery  (clean) byte-preserving s-expression layer + semantic-diff gate + kicad-cli wrapper
```

Writes flow down through Layer 0 (the only KiCad-file writer) and the Layer 1 mutation engine (the only
committer). Reads and computation (Layers 3 and 4) sit on top of the Layer 1 source of truth. The host
(Layer 5) is presentation plus the scraping engine; the frontend (Layer 6) is pure presentation.

## 5. Data layer (source of truth, derived index, settings, portability)

### 5.1 Source of truth stays text
Per-part JSON records plus the KiCad files (per-category `.kicad_sym`, `.pretty` dirs, `models/`,
`datasheets/`) are the git-synced, byte-preserving, per-line-mergeable source of truth. A binary
database as source of truth would destroy per-line history and invite whole-DB merge conflicts on every
sync, so it is rejected for the source of truth.

### 5.2 Derived SQLite index (the "proper database")
A SQLite database is built and refreshed on load and after every git pull, as the fast authoritative
query layer: full-text search, faceted filtering, duplicate detection, BOM joins, and the completion
passport rollup. It is a rebuildable cache derived from the text source and is never committed (it lives
under per-machine state, section 5.4). If it is deleted or corrupted, it rebuilds from the files. This
gives a real database for querying while keeping git clean.

### 5.3 Settings, split by portability
- **Portable shared settings** (fab presets, design-rule and net-class standards, the category taxonomy):
  git-synced as text in the repo and indexed in the SQLite index, so they resolve identically for a
  project on any machine. These are managed by the reused `nd_fab_presets` / `nd_design_presets` /
  `nd_netclass_manager` / `nd_pcb_profiles` logic.
- **Per-machine config** (KiCad install path, API keys, window state, active profile, sync preferences):
  lives outside the repo in per-machine state. Nothing machine-specific or secret ever enters the repo.

### 5.4 Path-portability resolver (what actually delivers the goal)
The requirement is that a project's parts resolve to the identical symbol, footprint, and 3D model on
any machine, independent of filesystem layout or the user's KiCad configuration. The mechanism:

- The library is carried inside the repo, so a clone gets the identical files everywhere.
- KiCad resolves every part through **one environment variable** (`SR_LIB` or the chosen name) plus stable
  `SR-` nicknames. Symbol rows point at `${SR_LIB}/symbols/<category>.kicad_sym`, footprint rows at
  `${SR_LIB}/footprints/<category>.pretty` directories, and 3D links are written as `${SR_LIB}/models/...`.
- Switching profile or machine is a one-variable flip plus a lib-table refresh; every `lib_id` reference in
  a project resolves identically.
- The lib-table and `kicad_common.json` writers are **scoped** (touch only `SR-` rows and the `SR_LIB` var,
  never the user's other libraries or the V10 `(type "Table")` row), **idempotent**, **safe** (timestamped
  backup, parse-validate after write), and **aware** (detect a running KiCad, report a restart is needed).

Note: even KiCad's native database-library feature would not solve footprint and 3D portability by itself
(those still resolve by path), so this resolver is required regardless of how metadata is stored. That is
why the derived-index model wins over native `.kicad_dbl` (which would also add an ODBC-driver setup burden
that cuts against "works regardless of their KiCad setup").

## 6. Completeness contract (the complete-to-add gate)

A component may not enter the primary library unless it is **complete**. Completeness is the
**strict full set** (owner-confirmed 2026-07-12): identity (name, MPN, manufacturer, category,
value/description), assets (symbol, footprint, 3D model, datasheet), and sourcing (purchase link). The
exact field keys and validation rules are finalized from the completion passport during M2 and enforced
in one place:

- The atomic add operation in the mutation engine **rejects** an add whose passport is not 100 percent, with
  an honest per-field report of what is missing (never a silent partial add).
- The add flow drives enrichment (section 6.1) to fill the passport before the gate is evaluated, so the
  gate is achievable rather than a wall.
- Editing an existing part toward completeness is always allowed; the gate is on entry to the primary
  library, not on working toward it in staging.

### 6.1 Scrape-first enrichment (no dependence on distributor APIs)
Owner decision (2026-07-13): enrichment is scrape-first and does NOT rely on the Mouser API, which is
unreliable (the 1000/day, 30/min cap plus general flakiness). The KiCad ecosystem (KiCost's decade of
scraping) warns that scrapers rot and get IP-banned, but that failure mode is specific to HTTP-client plus
CSS-selector scraping. Stockroom's approach is structurally more robust and dodges it:

1. **Real browser, not an HTTP client.** Stockroom hosts a real WebView2 engine, so it loads the pasted page
   in an actual browser context and reads the RENDERED DOM. This sails through the Cloudflare/Akamai JS
   challenges that fingerprint and ban HTTP scrapers. User initiated, one page at a time, never a crawler.
2. **Structured data first, CSS last.** The extraction cascade prioritizes machine-readable, SEO-stable
   sources that barely change across redesigns: schema.org JSON-LD `Product` markup, then OpenGraph/meta,
   then embedded JS state (`__NEXT_DATA__`-style), then per-site extractor modules, then heuristics. The
   low-rot layers carry most fields; CSS scraping is the last resort, not the first.
3. **The datasheet is a first-class, ban-proof source.** The datasheet PDF never rate-limits, never bans, and
   never redesigns. Follow the datasheet link (real User-Agent, Referer, HTTP/1.1 retry), validate by
   `Content-Type` plus `%PDF-` magic bytes, store it, and extract MPN/manufacturer/package/specs from it. This
   is the most stable enrichment source and is preferred over any distributor page.
4. **Mouser API is OPTIONAL and off by default.** Not the primary path, not a required floor, not enabled
   unless the user explicitly opts in. If enabled, it is one more source in the cascade; if disabled or
   capped, nothing breaks.

Robustness so scraping holds up (patterns validated by the ecosystem research, section reference below):
- **Polite pacing:** a sliding-window rate limiter (burst to N, then sleep `window - elapsed`) so Stockroom
  never hammers a site into banning it.
- **Per-part TTL cache** keyed on a filesystem-safe normalized MPN, so a part is never re-scraped needlessly.
- **Exact-MPN match:** on a multi-result page, prefer the row whose MPN equals the query, never blindly the
  first result (a classic wrong-part bug).
- **Priority-registry fall-through:** sources are tried in order; each fills what it can; the next only handles
  what is still missing.
- **Own the schema:** scraped fields are normalized into Stockroom's own versioned, category-keyed canonical
  schema, never a passthrough of a distributor's field names (which break silently when they change).

**Source-agnostic completeness (critical):** the complete-to-add gate must NEVER hard-depend on any single
source. A field a scraper misses is simply left for manual fill; a dead scraper can never wall a part off from
reaching complete. Enrichment never silently overwrites a filled field; changes to existing values are
per-field opt-in.

(Ecosystem evidence and the reuse/license map behind these choices:
`docs/research/2026-07-13-kicad-ecosystem-learnings.md`.)

## 7. Library archive and migration of the current library

The current library may contain incomplete or messy parts. Rather than force-complete them all up front or
lose them, the current library is **archived** and the clean library starts complete-only:

- On first run against an existing library, snapshot and import the current parts into an **Archive profile**
  (the profile mechanism already exists: one folder per profile). The Archive profile is preserved intact and
  stays usable in existing projects; it is exempt from the complete-to-add gate (grandfathered).
- The **primary profile** is complete-only from day one: every new add passes the section 6 gate.
- Archived parts are **completed and promoted per part, user-initiated** (owner-confirmed): open an archived
  part, run enrichment to fill its gaps, and promote it into the primary library once it passes the gate. Not
  an automatic bulk migration.
- The archive is created through the byte-preserving layer and committed as one scoped commit, so nothing is
  reformatted and the import is fully reversible.

## 8. Scope and milestone roadmap (Components plus full Projects, zero regression)

| M | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Foundation: byte-preserving KiCad file core, semantic-diff gate, file models, kicad-cli wrapper | Shipped (Stockroom), migrates in |
| M2 | Library data model, profiles, git sync, KiCad wiring, atomic mutation engine, **derived SQLite index**, **complete-to-add gate**, **archive import** | In progress (Stockroom store/vcs green; add the index, gate, archive) |
| M3 | Ingestion: content-fingerprint zip adapters, legacy upgrade, 3D re-linking, staging, LCSC path | Planned |
| M4 | Enrichment: **scraper-first** (purchase and datasheet links), WebView2 DOM fallback, datasheet fetcher, Mouser API as supplement (reuse-by-extraction of the old client into Qt-free modules) | Planned |
| M5 | Backend API + pywebview WebView2 shell + frozen-once launcher + git-pull self-update | Planned (needs Windows) |
| M6 | Frontend: Components UI from the web mockups, Ctrl+K palette, symbol/footprint/3D viewers, ingest, duplicates, settings, doctor | Planned |
| M7 | **Projects (full): audit, health, Editor (design rules / net classes / board setup), BOM, procurement, exports** (reuse-by-extraction of the `nd_*` modules and the BOM subsystem into Qt-free modules, routing KiCad writes through Layer 0) | Planned |
| M8 | Retire the PyQt app per-feature at parity | Planned |

Each milestone produces working, testable software and is adversarially reviewed and merged before the next.
The chain has real dependencies (M3 calls M2's mutation engine, M6 calls M5's API, M7 reuses M4 plus M1),
so it is a pipeline, not a parallel build. Two things always need one pass on the real Windows machine with
KiCad 10: the launcher (M5) and the final KiCad wiring and preview verification.

## 9. Migration and consolidation approach

**Approach: engine-first (chosen over shell-first and dual-track).** Absorb Stockroom's shipped clean-room
core into this repo as the new engine, continue its milestones, and plug reuse in at the natural points:
M4 enrichment reuses the old Mouser and parsing logic, M7 Projects wraps the `nd_*` modules and the BOM
subsystem. This honors "byte-preservation is the whole game" (never build on the old reformatting engine)
and "reuse mature logic where good." Shell-first was rejected because it would build the app over the exact
engine being replaced then require a risky swap; dual-track was rejected because it is the two-conflicting-
directions problem this document ends.

**Consolidation:** the rewrite lives in this (Hardware) repo under `stockroom/` with a single history.
Stockroom's shipped engine migrates in (`sexp/`, `verify/`, `kicad/`, `model/`, `store/`, `vcs/`,
`mutation/`), the FastAPI backend and React frontend follow the Electron spec's structure adapted to the
WebView2 host, and the reused `nd_*` and BOM logic is extracted from `tools/` into Qt-free modules
(section 2.1). The repo may be renamed `stockroom` once the PyQt app is fully retired.

**Reuse mechanics:** governed by the zero-Qt constraint in section 2.1. In short, the `nd_*` modules
reference no Qt directly but most import `LibraryManager` (the Qt hub), so reuse is by extraction: lift
LibraryManager's pure logic and re-point the `nd_*` imports at the Qt-free extracted modules, satisfy
`parse_sexpr` from the clean-room layer, and never import `fp_render` (replaced by kicad-cli plus three.js).
The extractions land at the milestones that consume them (M4 enrichment, M7 Projects and BOM); each ships as
Qt-free modules behind the CI gate.

## 10. Coexistence and cutover

- The PyQt app (`tools/ui/**`) stays working and remains the shipped app until the rewrite reaches parity on a
  feature, then that feature cuts over. The v2.x PyQt line goes bug-fix-only; no new PyQt feature work.
- Cut over per-feature only when the rewrite surface reaches parity and passes its gates (section 11).
- The old in-app updater is not ported; the rewrite's update path is git-pull self-update (section 12).

## 11. Testing

- **Clean-room (Layers 0 to 2):** golden-file byte round-trip tests, the independent semantic-diff gate, and
  property-based tests for the s-expression layer. Real vendor zips as ingestion fixtures.
- **Data layer:** the derived index rebuilds deterministically from fixtures; the complete-to-add gate has
  tests proving an incomplete add is rejected and a complete add succeeds; archive import is round-trip tested.
- **Enrichment:** scraper tests against saved HTML fixtures, datasheet validation tests (magic bytes, HTML
  wrapper rejection), an opt-in live smoke suite. Rate-limit degradation to the scraper is tested.
- **API:** pytest plus httpx against a fixture library and project.
- **Frontend:** Vitest for hooks and components; **Playwright drives the real app (the new drive-audit) and
  screenshots it against the mockups (the new render gate)**.
- **Zero-Qt gate:** a CI check greps the backend package for any `PyQt5`, `QtCore`, `QtWidgets`, or `QtGui`
  import and fails on a hit, so the section 2.1 constraint cannot rot.
- **Release gate:** Windows CI stays the gate; the reused `nd_*` and BOM logic keeps its existing unit tests.
  Claims always name the environment they rest on; Linux/offscreen green is necessary, never sufficient.

## 12. Resolved decisions (owner, 2026-07-12)

1. **Product name:** **Stockroom.** The rewrite ships under this name; this (Hardware) repo is its home and
   may be renamed `stockroom` later.
2. **Top-level directory:** `stockroom/`.
3. **Update model:** **git-pull ff-only self-update** (Update control plus a non-blocking on-launch check; a
   graceful restart; frozen-once launcher; the library carried in-repo, so one pull ships code, UI, and data).
4. **Complete-to-add gate:** the **strict full set** (identity: name, MPN, manufacturer, category,
   value/description; assets: symbol, footprint, 3D model, datasheet; sourcing: purchase link).
5. **Archive promotion:** **per part, user-initiated** (enrich, then promote when the part passes the gate).
6. **Zero Qt in the backend:** hard constraint enforced by a CI gate (section 2.1).

Left to finalize in M2 (implementation detail, not a direction fork): the precise passport field keys and
their validation rules.

## 13. Non-goals (this direction)

- No EDA tool other than KiCad, and no KiCad below the V10 target (V9-compatible files are preserved, never
  silently upgraded).
- No hosted, multi-user, or cloud service; this is a local tool with full local filesystem, git, and KiCad
  access. Sync is git; collaborators are trusted committers.
- No routing engine in this direction (the PyQt app's routing stays shelved as its own concern).
- No rewrite of the reused `nd_*` and BOM logic beyond decoupling it from Qt and re-routing its KiCad writes
  through Layer 0.
