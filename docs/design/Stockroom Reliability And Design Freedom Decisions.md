# Stockroom Reliability And Design Freedom Decisions

This concise log records the durable product and architecture decisions for the reliability and
complete-design-freedom work. Implementation evidence belongs in tests and Git, not here.

## Accepted Decisions

### Draft, Applied, And Shipped Are Separate

A Draft autosaves for recovery but changes only Design Studio preview. Apply To This PC creates a
local active snapshot. Publish Release remains an explicit developer action. Application updates
preserve both personal and applied design data.

### Global Means One Semantic Element Everywhere

The editor exposes no Instance, Role, or Screen scope choice. An authored or generated target key
addresses the same semantic source element across every route, state, and repeated render. Color
remains independently editable for Light and Dark; other properties are shared.

### Complete Exposure Uses Hybrid Identity

Authored `data-dev-id` values remain stable public identities. The build supplies deterministic
identities to all other Stockroom-owned JSX elements, and imperative DOM uses an explicit helper.
Coverage is derived from the rendered production tree rather than an opt-in marker.

### Editor Chrome Is The Recovery Boundary

Every application element, including the preview root, may be hidden or rearranged. Design Studio's
own chrome is not an editable target. Ctrl+Shift launch bypass and Reset Applied Design provide
recovery from an unusable applied design.

### Provider Browsing Is Modal And Native

The provider document uses a dedicated native WebView positioned inside a draggable, resizable
React modal. The primary Stockroom WebView remains on the app. Close hides the surface without
canceling the acquisition workflow.

### Releases Stay Immutable

The frozen launcher activates verified immutable release generations. It never updates production
by mutating the active checkout. Trusted metadata recovery is anchored in the packaged root and
verified root history. Each successful main release uses `0.7.0.<build number>`.
