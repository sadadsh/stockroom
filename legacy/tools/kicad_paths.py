    The version is the directory that contains ``bin`` (e.g.

    parsed integer tuple is what makes 10.0 rank ABOVE 9.0 — a plain string
    sort would place "10.0" before "9.0" and drive the older install.

    Returns ``(version_tuple, is_64bit)`` so that, on a version tie, the
    64-bit install (not under "Program Files (x86)") wins. Paths whose
    version segment has no digits sort lowest via an empty version tuple.

    KiCad install paths are Windows paths; parse them separator-agnostically so
    the backslash version segment is found even when this runs on POSIX (where
    ``pathlib`` would treat the whole ``C:\\...\\bin`` string as one component).
